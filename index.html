            I am a full stack engineer with a huge passion for web development.
            As someone who is motivated and strives to be creative and
            intuitive, I do my best to create applications that go above and
            beyond the user's expectations. These past 2 years of coding have
            allowed me to explore and discover the endless world of development,
            I'm excited to push forward and to continue polishing my skills as a
            developer. I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and create
            code that can change the world.

            When I am not geeking out about coding I enjoy bowling, playing
            table tennis, pickleball, running, and playing with my two mountain
            doodle pups Bagel and Pancake! I also enjoy attending various Smash
            locals and tournaments throughout San Diego!

              MadPass is a project me and some friends in college created when
              practicing and honing our dev skills, we wanted to take on a new
              challenge of using new technologies we were not entirely familliar
              with. This application allows a user to quickly and easily save
              and store login and password information for a variety of
              websites, accounts, apps, etc. My team used Node.js, Express.js,
              MongoDB / Mongoose, Crypto npm module to encrypt data, encryption
              algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption System) with a 256 bit
              encryption key, and Bcrypt. I worked on both the front and back
              end making sure the layout and UI was simple and clean, and
              assuring that redirection of the pages along with login and
              password management were successful.

            <p>
              As I transitioned from an intern to a full time dev for Family
              Proud, I have worked on all aspects of our application. Using
              ReactJS, we have built a platform that allows patients to better
              communicate and coordinate with families in their times of need
              and help ease the burden of care. I have worked on both the front
              and back end of the application touching up resource pages and
              links, adding features to the messaging system, fixing database
              issues within Firebase, also worked on the company landing page
              using GatsbyJS fixing redirection errors and bugs. Also added
              analytics via Mixpanel to help track user data, clicks, and
              application usage that allowed Product and Marketing teams to make
              better decisions based on user activity.

              pages and landing pages for clients and franchise auto shops all
              around the U.S. with constant client to developer interactions,
              fixing and diagnosing bugs within a clients pages, updating
              content and utilizing SEO techniques to improve page rankings,
              making sure all pages were ADA compliant. Managed over 20+ plugins
              as well for seamless web integrations, take a look at specifically
              the Aftercare Pages, Elite Dealer Pages, and product pages to take
              a look at pages I alone built and worked on :-]

              As a software developer for Ceramic Pro LLC, I worked on CP Shop
              Manager - a subscription based marketing software offered to auto
              shops all around the world that enabled users to increase lead
              income via a dedicated lead system, start marketing campaigns,
              create warranties, view ongoing and canned jobs, and help with the
              overall management of their auto shop and itâ€™s internal business
              interactions. Built in React, I created new and improved upon
              existing features - in particular building out a dedicated lead
              form system via a code snippet that could be injected through HTML
              to a form on a shop's website.
